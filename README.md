PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Medical decisioning depends on medical history of a patient. Doctors typically use past patient records from multiple visits collected through lab tests, procedures and patient diagnoses records to determine the right treatment. The medical history and patient demographics can be used to identify and analyse patterns that groups patients into cohorts.The cohorts formed vary in terms of diseases, test results and patient data. Electronic Health Records are a systematic way to collect huge amounts of digital health information from multiple sources. Accessing this data and using it to create the cohorts presents initial analysis and proper medical path to be followed for any patient dependingon the results from similar patients belonging to the same cohort.
The problem is clearly identified as an unsupervised machine learning problem and I will use relevant algorithms to distinguish various cohorts based on their differences. Furthermore, this analysis can be used for drug analysis, identifying disease progression and much more.
